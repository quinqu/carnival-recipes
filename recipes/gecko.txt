Dan's Meatloaf
--------------
Time: 1 hour

6 slices White Bread
3/4 teaspoons Salt
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 cup Brown Sugar

2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
10. Bake for 45 minutes, then pour another 1/3 of the sauce over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes.
